# Data Transformation

## Drop unused variables

### these are constant

- Over18
- EmployeeCount
- StandardHours

### the meaning of these is unclear, so we drop them

- DailyRate
- MonthlyRate
- HourlyRate

### These are solely for identification

- EmployeeNumber

## Address non-normality in numeric variables.

### We will apply tranforms as follows:

Age - None  
Distance From Home - Square Root  
Monthly Income - Log  
YearsAtCompany - Log  
YearsSinceLastPromotion - Log  
YearsWithCurrentManager - Log  
WorkLifeBalance - None  
TotalWorkingYears - Squre Root  
PerformanceRating - None  
PercentSalaryHike - None  
JobLevel - None  
StockOptionLevel - None  
Education - None  
EnvironmentSatisfaction - None  
JobInvolvement - None
JobSatisfaction - None
NumCompaniesWorked - None
RelationshipSatisfaction - None
TrainingTimesLastYear - None
WorkLifeBalance - None
YearsInCurrentRole - None
